# PCB1 Enginering Design Files
The PCBs were created with Eagle v9.3.2.

The PCB1 itself is a double layer PCB with most components being SMD. Only a few capacitors, specified by Bob as being silver-mica or polyester, are through-hole.

Gerber-files will be placed here when they become available. These are the production-files that can be sent to a PCB-manufacturer. I typically use JLCPCB.
