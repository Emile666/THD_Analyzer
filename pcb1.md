*PCB1 Top-layer Layout*

The PCBs were created with Eagle v9.3.2. The PCB itself is a double layer PCB with most components being SMD. Only a few capacitors, specified by Bob as being silver-mica or polyester, are through-hole.

# PCB1 Schematics
The schematics consists of three sheets:
- Sheet 1: the signal generator
- Sheet 2: the relays and the digital logic
- Sheet 3: the power-supply

# Design-details
I named the bits from the HC595 shift-registers R01-R24 (R15 and R16 are not connected), with R01 being the first bit to shift into the shift-registers. They have the following meaning:
- R01: f=25 Hz to R10: f=200 Hz. For f=20 Hz all bits (R01-R10) need to be 0.
- R11: Range = 200 Hz, R12: Range = 2 kHz, R13: Range is 20 kHz. R14: Range is 200 kHz.
- PCB1 V0.30 only: R15: Range = 200 Hz, R16: Range = 2 kHz, R17: Range is 20 kHz.
- PCB1 V0.21 only: R15 until R19: these bits are not used.
- PCB1 V0.30 only: R18 and R19 are not used.
- R20: Output Level is 5 V.
- R21: Output Level if not OFF.
- R22: Output Level is 0.15 V.
- R23: Output Level is 0.5 V.
- R24: Output Level is 1.5 V or 5 V.

The MAIN.OUT signal is also sent to the microcontroller (via CON3) for both frequency and level measurement.

# Mounting of components and Unit-testing
Use this test-document to get a working PCB1 signal generator: [PCB1 Unit Test](img/PCB1_Unit_Test.pdf). Mounting of components is done in such a way that the individual resistors and capacitors that set a particular frequency can be 
measured. In this way, it is assured that every individual relay does work and the resistor and capacitance values are correct.

In order to test this, a working PCB4 (ÂµC control board) is needed. PCB4 should be connected to a host-PC with an USB-to-UART adapter, communication settings are 57600,N,8,1. See the [PCB4](./pcb4.md) page for more details.
